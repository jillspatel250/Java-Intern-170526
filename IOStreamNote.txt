IOStreams:-
we control and manage and prefrom operation on input output data
streams:-flow of data
Buffer:-buffer is a memory object that holding data for sometime
        example:- PC1 is faster and PC2 is slower and we transfer data
                  PC1 to PC2 so it send very fast so PC2 not control that
                  so that is not happend we put one buffer between that
                  so PC1 put data on buffer and PC2 take it slowlly based
                  on their capcaity
Majorlly Java Provide 2 type of classes for implementing IOStream .
ByteStream Class:-
InputStream
OutputStream

CharacterStream Class:-
Reader
Writer

--NOTE:- WE only check Wrapper class type not primitive type
if we need to check b type so using autoboxing we need to convert it into Wrapper class then we check
int b;
Integer boxing=b;
System.out.println(boxing.getClass().getName());
