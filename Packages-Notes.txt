in java we have lots of file and all are same so that we can combine and that call package

packages are nothing but a collection of set of classes , interfaces and sub packages


we have two ways to use class
1.using making that object
2.extends that class


//1. same class
//2. same package non-sub class
//3. same package sub-class
//4. diff package sub-class
//5. diff package non-subclass

package mypack1;
//same package same class or same package non-sub class
class Test{


}
//same packge sub-class
class Test2 extends Test{


}


//different package
package myPack2;
//diff package non-sub class
class Testd1{


}

//diff package sub-class
class Test2d extends Test1d{


}
